            The Club Helping Veterans is a diverse group of individuals, with
            one thing in common: We all have a tremendous love and respect for
            our country and for those who risk their lives every day, whether on
            American soil or abroad, in securing our nationâ€™s freedoms and
            liberties. We encourage those who share this respect to join us in
            support of all those who have served and still are serving.
