            Being part of a ride group is a great way to get that missing hint
            of novelty in your life. Each ride takes you to new places, makes
            you see new faces, and while each face comes with its own
            eccentricities, the one thing that remains a common thread among all
            is their love for rubber on tarmac and freedom.
